TODO list for Net::Ping (in case anyone is looking for things to do)

- IPv6 support
There is a patch on the CPAN RT for adding IPv6 support.  This needs to be looked over to
determine what will work.  Now that Socket is on CPAN and Net::Ping assumes a recent version,
I can assume that many of the IPv6 functions and constants are available.  Better yet, some
options like IP_TOS and IP_TTL are not available on IPv6

- modernization and general cleanup
If I add the IPv6 changes from the patch (or something similar), we'll be up to seven optional
parameters for new.  my $ping = Net::Ping->new(undef, undef, undef, undef, undef, undef, 'v6') 
is just weird.  Initialization through a hash ref seems to be in order.  Other cleanups seem
to be in order in the code.

- warnings and strict
It's time.  They need to be added to the module and to the tests.  I'll start with warnings
across the board, cleanup as needed, then work on strict.

- HiRes time by default?
I think this is preferable.  I've already made Time::HiRes a prereq.  The code assumed users
had it in the hires() method, but I'm guessing that almost every installation had it since it has
been included in the Perl core since at least Perl 5.8.0.  Also, integer time is just not 
fine-grained enough for most uses.

- POD rewriting
Some things, such as the return from $p->ping(), are cryptic.  The location of the
source is off as well.

- Tests
Nicholas Clark converted the tests to Test::More which is a good start.  The tests need some
cleanup and modernizing.  With IPv6, the curent tests will need to be nearly doubled.  Also, 
my guess is that the current test coverage is pretty low, so some quality time with Devel::Cover
is also in order.
